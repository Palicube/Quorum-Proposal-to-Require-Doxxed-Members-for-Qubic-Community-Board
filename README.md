## Details
This proposal recommends that only individuals who have disclosed their real-world identities (“doxxed”) **and** are not directly affiliated with the Valis blockchain be eligible to serve on the Qubic Community Board. The aim is to maintain Qubic’s governance integrity, ensure transparency, and prevent real or perceived conflicts of interest.

## Background & Rationale

1. **Conflict of Interest Prevention**  
   - Individuals connected to the Valis blockchain may have competing interests that could influence decision-making or resource allocation.  

2. **Maintaining Ecosystem Independence**  
   - Ensuring Board members have no direct Valis ties helps Qubic preserve its autonomy and focus solely on its own ecosystem’s advancement.  

3. **Strengthening Stakeholder Confidence**  
   - A Board composed of doxxed, non–Valis-affiliated individuals fosters greater trust among community members, ecosystem projects, and investors.  

4. **Transparency & Accountability**  
   - Requiring members to be doxxed adds an extra layer of accountability, as professional reputations are on the line and decision-makers are publicly identifiable.

## Scope of the Proposal

- **Definition of Valis Affiliation**  
  - Affiliation with Valis blockchain includes, but is not limited to, employment, partnerships, significant token holdings, or any arrangement that directly binds an individual to Valis’s financial or strategic interests.

- **Board Eligibility Requirement**  
  - Prospective Qubic Community Board members must declare that they do not have—and will not assume—any direct affiliation with the Valis blockchain.  
  - Members must also be doxxed, disclosing their real-world identities and relevant background information to the quorum (or a designated governance body) for verification.
